With my 5 years of experience in full-stack development and recent leadership experience at StartupXYZ, I believe I can contribute significantly to your product development goals. I'm particularly drawn to the technical challenges you're solving and the opportunity to mentor other developers.",
            
            # Response 2: Technical expertise
            "I have extensive experience with your tech stack. I've been working with Python for over 5 years, primarily using Django and FastAPI for backend development. On the frontend, I'm proficient in React and have built several large-scale applications. I've worked with both PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and I'm comfortable with AWS services like EC2, RDS, and Lambda. I also have experience with Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration.",
            
            # Response 3: Leadership and problem-solving
            "At StartupXYZ, I led a team of 4 developers to rebuild our legacy monolithic system into a microservices architecture. The biggest challenge was maintaining system stability while migrating live data. I implemented a phased approach with extensive testing and rollback procedures. We reduced system downtime by 80% and improved response times by 60%. I also established code review processes and mentored two junior developers who were promoted during my tenure.",
            
            # Response 4: Handling challenges
            "One of the most challenging projects was when we had a critical performance issue affecting 50,000+ users. I had to quickly diagnose the problem, which turned out to be a database query optimization issue. I implemented database indexing, query optimization, and added caching layers. I also set up monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues. The experience taught me the importance of proactive monitoring and performance testing.",
            
            # Response 5: Career goals and cultural fit
            "I'm looking for a role where I can have greater technical impact and grow my leadership skills. I'm passionate about building scalable systems and creating positive team cultures. I believe in collaborative development, continuous learning, and knowledge sharing. I'd love to contribute to TechCorp's engineering culture and help build systems that can scale with your growth. I'm also interested in exploring AI/ML integration, which aligns with your company's direction.",
            
            # Response 6: Questions and closing
            "I'm curious about the team structure and how you approach technical decision-making. What are the biggest technical challenges the team is currently facing? Also, what opportunities are there for professional development and learning new technologies? I'm excited about the possibility of joining TechCorp and contributing to your mission."
